    // Act 2 event.

    // As you climb up a floor, you stumble upon what you instantly recognize as a...formal event?
    // The floor is lit.
    // The masks are on.
    // The gremlin band is playing.
    // This is a Masquarade Ball!
    // You decide to participate...but what do you do?

    // [Gossip.]
        // You get yourself a small glass of juice and lean against the table, next to two gremlins that seem to be in a very interesting conversation.
        // "Can you believe it! And, about the band leader ..."
        // You hear them out, and there's a small spot where you can intervene.
            // [Join In.] Oh my dear, that is *Nothing*. You know what I heard?...
                // They both gasp! [shaking]What a hot piece of gossip![shaking] Those rumors will surely last! At least, as long as the ball does.
                // Add a 'Hot Gossip!' colorless card to your deck that costs 2(1) and stuns everyone, then exhausts.
            // [Keep listening.]

                    // ADD A DOUBT TO YOUR DECK.

    // [Flirt.]
    // You lay your eyes on one of the taller creatures and decide try your charm. It seems that the interest is mutual!
    // As you get to know each other, the coat it's wearing unbuttons on it's own, and they instantly cover themselves up. How scandalous!
        // [Proceed.] Offer to take them somewhere more private.
            // You and the taller creature move to an empty room...
                // [Proceed.]
                    // The coat comes off ! It was 3 gremlins in a trenchcoat all along!
                    // They run scram, giggling away. Now everyone at the ball know what happened. ADD 1 SHAME TO YOUR DECK.
    // Option 2: Maybe not right now.
        // You decide that it's not in your best interest to indulge in such things. You have more important things to attend to.
          // Add 'Dedication' colorless card to your deck. -

    // [Steal.]
        // You notice a gentlecreature engaged in conversation. He's absolutely not paying attention to his pockets, but taking something could be risky.
