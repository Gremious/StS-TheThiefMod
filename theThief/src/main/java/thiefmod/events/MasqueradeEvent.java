    // Act 2 event.

    // As you climb up a floor, you stumble upon what you instantly recognize as a...formal event?
    // The floor is lit. // Add the image layers 1 by 1. It's all on a new screen
    // The masks are on.
    // The gremlin band is playing.
    // This is a Masquarade Ball!
    // You decide to participate...but what do you do?

    // [Gossip.]
        // You get yourself a small glass of juice and lean against the table, next to two gremlins that seem to be in a very interesting conversation.
        // "Can you believe it! And, about the band leader ..."
        // You hear them out for a while, and spot a small spot where you can intervene.
            // [Join In.] Oh my dear, that is *Nothing*. You know what I heard?...
                // They both gasp! [shaking]What a hot piece of gossip![shaking] Those rumors will surely last! At least, as long as the ball does.
                // Add a 'Hot Gossip!' colorless card to your deck that costs 2(1) and stuns everyone, then exhausts.
            // [Keep listening.]
                // Oh Neowl! Really?? [shaking]The Merchant!?[shaking] This makes you question everything..."
                    // ADD A DOUBT TO YOUR DECK.

    // [Flirt.]
      // You lay your eyes on one of the taller creatures and decide try your charm. The more you talk the more it seems that the interest is mutual!
      // As you get to know each other, the coat it's wearing unbuttons on it's own, and they instantly cover themselves up. How scandalous!
          // [Proceed.] Offer to take them somewhere more private.
              // @You and the taller creature move to a dimply-lit, empty room...@
                  // [Proceed.]
                      // The coat comes off ! It was 3 gremlins in a trenchcoat all along!
                      // They scram, giggling away. Now everyone at the ball know what happened. ADD 1 SHAME TO YOUR DECK.
          //[Maybe not right now.]
              // As you talk, you take a step back and remember why you were here in the first place.
                  // [Proceed.]
                      // You decide that it's not in your best interest to indulge in such things. You have more important things to attend to.
                      // Add 'Dedication' colorless card to your deck. - 0 mana, deal 5 (7) damage and draw 1 card.

    // [Steal.]
        // You notice a creature in a black suit, heavily engaged in conversation. He's absolutely not paying attention to his pockets, but taking something could still be risky.
            // [Steal.]
                // You attempt to sneakily pull something out of his pocket...but you are caught by a guard patroling the ballroom! ADD 1 NORMALITY.
            // [Engage in conversation.]
                // If you have mod installed - He's really engaged in talking about money...this is a spire investor! After his friend goes away, you ask him if he help you get started, and he's very eager to help out. Get 1 copy of spire co stock card.
                // If you don't, just get gold.

    // [Drink Wine.]
        // You decide to relax a bit and lean back again the table with the fruity-juice bowl.
            // Heal 15% max hp. Add a Drunk curse to your deck.
            // Drunk - When you draw this card, shuffle 2 "Dazed" into your draw and discard piles. Exhaustive 2.
